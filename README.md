Hi folks, really thanks for your attention. This is James Li from Hong Kong.

It's really glad to meet you. Today, I'm honored to tell you about myself and I'm really happy about that.

I'm a professional web developer and have been working in this field for 7 long years. I have a bachelor's degree in computer engineering from the University of Hong Kong.

I have solid knowledge in programming and graphic designing and my works are not only enchanting but also integrated with graphics, video, and audio. I'm also skillful in problem-solving methods and acquainted with computer languages like modern Javascript, PHP, python, and multimedia publishing tools like Photoshop.

Besides, my websites are SEO friendly because they didn't fail to satisfy the users. Again, I keep myself up to date with new technologies and their uses, new tools, and computer languages so that I can give my level best to my clients.

I look forward to hearing from you. If you'd like to contact me, please send me an email. My email is secret0910star@gmail.com.

Thank you.
